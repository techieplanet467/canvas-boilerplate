# HTML5 Canvas Boilerplate
This is a template file to get started with HTML5 Canvas creations using Javascript.  
You can use this template for any purpose. Actually this is inspired by this [repo on github](https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate).
But this one is very simplified and doesn't uses any libraries or backends.
